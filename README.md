# british-bingo
If like me, you've ever been volunteered to be a bingo caller, then you'll know there's a bit of knack to it.  To make it fun, it's not just reading out the numbers - you need the phrases that go with it.  Also chances are your audience will be a. old as all hell, and b. drinking.  So it helps if there's a big screen that the numbers come up on.  Since you are likely drinking too, there's a lot to keep track of.

So that's why I wrote this British Bingo calling program with the following features

Display the current number in big letters for all the drunk old giffers that can't hear you properly

Display what numbers have been called before so you can check the old giffers are not cheating you

Give you the phrase that goes along with the number, so afterwards people can tell you how cool you are
